TheAncestor is a Discord bot which plays quotes from the Ancestor (also called the Narrator) in the game Darkest Dungeon. You can request a specific quote, a random quote, or set the bot to play random quotes at semi-regular intervals. I made the bot because a couple of my friends are fans of the game and particuarly like the Ancestor. 

The sound files and transcripts used by the bot are not included in this repository; instead, I include the script used to scrape them off the Darkest Dungeon fan wiki.
